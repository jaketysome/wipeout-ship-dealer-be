      "The FEISAR craft is very agile, with a high thrust output and relatively strong shields. Most of the time you will be able to navigate a course without even touching the airbrakes, and as a result it is an excellent craft to learn in as the airbrakes take time to master. However, since it is biased towards high manoeuvrability and ease of use, it is the slowest craft in the game and will often struggle to keep up with the other teams over the course of a race, especially in the higher speed classes.",

      "The AG Systems F5000 craft is very agile, with the strongest thrusters of any craft and a speed far superior to that of the FEISAR. While it may be a good stepping stone for those who prefer the smooth handling of a lighter craft, the shield strength is very poor, meaning the craft will be unable to take a lot of punishment necessary to last through some of the longer races.",

This craft is a good step up from AG Systems, but still handles well enough to be a very useful craft in the faster speed classes. Its shields are still a little on the low side though.",

      "Qirex had certainly earned their place at the top of the AG league, by having the fastest craft of them all. It takes a while to get going, but once this ship is up to speed, there is little that can touch it. It also has the strongest shields of all the craft, making it very hard to take down as well. However, this craft is not for inexperienced pilots, as it handles very poorly. Only use the Qirex craft once you have mastered the airbrakes.",

      "This prototype craft is the ultimate AG racer, perfect in every way. It is extremely fast, extremely agile, and has nearly impenetrable shield technology. No other craft in the F5000 League could stand up to this beast in a straight race. However, in order for it to exhibit such incredible speed and agility, Piranha had taken the drastic step of designing it without a weapons system, as it would have imbalanced the craft and reduced its aerodynamic capabilities. Despite such impressive stats, the P.666 is recommended for experts only, as the sheer speed and sharpness of the turning and airbrakes require very quick reactions and a solid knowledge of each track.",
